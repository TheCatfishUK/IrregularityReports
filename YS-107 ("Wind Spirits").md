## **Irregularity Description**

The Wind Spirits are a type of Fae creature that resides in the park. They are, as yet, uncounted as they are capricious and hard to distinguish at smaller sizes, but larger instances have personalities of their own and distinguishable characteristics.

#### Anabatic *(Atty)* - Ascending Wind

Anabatic, or Atty as she currently prefers to be known, is one of the more powerful Wind Spirits at home in the Park. She likes to uplift blaseballs, giving a small boost to players that have spent time in her vicinity.

She used to go by Anna, but changed the nickname she goes by to be more in line with her 'Sister' Katty.

#### Katabatic *(Katty)* - Decending Wind

Katabatic, or Katty as she currently prefers to be known, is one of the more powerful Wind Spirits at home in the Park. She revels in being the "Wind behind the runners" and likes to help give people an edge in sprinting.

[^1]: Rangers Buster and Thyme have had words with the creature with butterfly wings and have informed them to stop scamming visitors, or at least stop impersonating Parkpark staff when they do so.
