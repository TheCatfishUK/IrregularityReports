# YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK
## NATIONAL PARK SERVICES STANDARDIZED IRREGULARITY REPORT

**Documenting Researcher:** Researcher E. Tunnel

**Irregularity Designation:** YS-145 ("Sword Lake")

**Irregularity Class:** NATIVE


## **Park Management Protocol:**

* Rangers are not to advise anybody to seek shelter within sight of the lake, see additional notes below.
* No water that is taken from the lake is to be ingested
* No flora found in the vicinity (up to a mile radius) is to be removed.

## **Irregularity Description:**

The location in question appears to be a standard looking lake, just over a mile across at it's widest, surrounded with an amount of woodland. No foliage comes within approx 10ft of the high water mark.

Evidence of habitation has been found pre-dating the Late Archaic period, but not matching any local historical activity. Collected stories have mentioned the lake as a focal point of healing and safety, but nothing about any people who resided there. Carbon-dating found items has been inconclusive.

Increased sightings of a figure emerging from the lake have come from sources outside of the Rangers, suspect "Bigfoot" hunters drumming up attention.

## **Additional Notes:**

Sword Lake has been used for many years for a safe retreat from many dangers within the park, but in recent months has caused many to take shelter on it's shore to vanish.

Approximately 30% of people who have vanished have since returned with no ability to *verbally* explain where they have been, but they have been able to draw it.
